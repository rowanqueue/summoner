- paths that make agents/player faster (go underneath tile, like concrete)
- research to make agents stats better
-- tiles that augment that specific agent
-- but this research should also not make investing in new agent types a bad idea
- hmm should there be structures that are bigger than one tile??
- arrow types
-- normal splitter where it just alternates clockwise between every option you want
-- splitter that splits you based on item on that slot
-- age based splitter
-- "logic" where splitter can be ON|OFF depending on signal (just a boolean signal)
--- this implies a "wire" layer where you connect stuff yuck
- avatar doesn't follow grid
-- has special power
-- has to craft at workbench like in satisfactory
- terrain challenges like rivers that only certain guys can 
-- blue guy (frog) collects water by crossing river

- crafting tree to first "science"
-- what if each science is a different guy that has to do something (or rather that only that guy can craft it)
-- a science pack is a guy who is summoned and then has to do that particular recipe somewhere


todo before testing:
	- multiplayer testing tomorrow
	-- when someone enters, spawn them as a free agent
	-- they send data packets for the following:
		+ moving
		- editing tiles (inventory or building tbh)
		- spawning agent
	- ghost item system? maybe think of that later lol
	- rethink how much tiles should cost (if they have their own items)
	- copy and paste!!!
	-- a way to make blueprints (ctrl+c)
	-- a way to place blueprints (ctrl+v)
	-- rotate entire blueprint
	-- later save blueprint (ctrl+s)
	
	- mod tiles (unlocked by research)
	--skip next tile
	--+1 or -1 craft for next 
	- make tech badges clearer
	-- add description
	-- make tile unlock with images
	- make tech visualizer that shows all techs, like the recipe visualizer
	- make research tree that acts as tutorial
	-- start with sigil, bush, hex, kill, altar
	-- unlock arrows
	--- unlock splitter
	-- unlock dropoff
	-- unlock skip
	-- later unlock bulk craft tile
	-- later unlock item marking + ghost items
	
	-- unlock water agent
	-- unlock lumber agent (can get sticks from trees)
	- controls on screen
